`carp-foodweb-change` is an series of `R` scripts (R Core Team 2022) providing analyses, 
figures, and tables for the manuscript "Investigating changes to food web structure after fish removal using size spectra analysis"
published in Ecosphere 

The purpose of the package is to recreate figures and tables presented in the main text 
and appendix of the manuscript "Investigating changes to food web structure after fish removal using size spectra analysis"
Data is pulled in the scripts from the Environmental Data Initiative where data is archived. 

If there are any issues please contact the author, Tyler Butts (tyler.james.butts@gmail.com) with the subject line 'carp-foodweb-change issue - please help'. Thank you!
